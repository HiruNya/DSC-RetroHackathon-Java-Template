# Retro Hackathon Template

This is a Java template for the [DSC Retro Game Hackathon](https://github.com/Developer-Student-Club-UoA/RetroGameHackathon).
If you wish to use this template, copy this template into your forked github repository.

This game is certainly not perfect (or fun) yet - but that's up to you!
This template is meant to be a base project to help you make your own game.
It's meant to show you the basics - movement, shooting, and collision.
You are definitely not locked into this type of game for the hackathon so feel free to get creative.

## Dependencies

This template only relies on fxgl.
Make sure you look at the [fxgl repository](https://github.com/AlmasB/FXGL) to figure out how to install and use the fxgl library.
